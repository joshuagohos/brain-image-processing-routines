# SPM SUB-ROUTINES
- This README last updated by Josh Goh 2026119.
Sub-routines for SPM functions used in Brain Mind Lab (BML).
These routines are BASH shell scripts that generate Matlab scripts that define SPM jobs with option to run the jobs. The scripts are a wrappers that pass the code through Matlab instances. 

NOTES: The shell scripts implement several default SPM job parameter settings as used in BML. Users should validate that the settings are appropriate for their specific study and revise them accordingly.
